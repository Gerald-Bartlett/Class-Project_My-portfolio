                       <h6>Who I am</h6>
                       <p class="p-preview"> 
                           I was born and raised in Central Newfoundland. Grew up in a small town called Embree. My parents had a large family of 6 children.
                           We grew up poor but secure, I learned hard work at an early age of 10. My brother and I dug ditches and cleaned out wells and sold firewood 
                        so we could help our parents purchase school clothes for us. So I know the value of a dollar and hard work.                 
                        I am a Husband and father. We have 3 wonderful children. 
                        I was previously employed with the same electrical company for 8 years. Prior to that I had been employed with 
                        2 other electrical companies. 
                        <p class="p-preview" >I am currently a Software Development student at Keyin College. I am passionate about design and software development because 
                        creating things is a real passion of mine. In my spare time to relax, I enjoy working with carpentry whether it's building
                        a set of kitchen cabinets or a desk it starts out has just wood and when I'm done it's a new creation; the same goes for computer 
                        software & design and coding (using Pycharm for Python
                        or Html webpages through Vs Code) I See it come alive onscreen before my eyes, it is just as satisfying.
                        I spent many years in the electrical trade and have experience interacting with customers on a daily basis.
                        I have learned to ask the right questions so that I understand what the customer wants, & at times they didn't know what they wanted so it was my job to
                        give them ideas and solutions to the project at hand. <br>
                        <br>I am very easy to get along with and I treat everyone as I would want to be treated. 
                        Professionalism is a key component of my attitude & character, I will prove to you that you need me!.
                        I look forward to hearing from you,
                        Thank you. <br>
