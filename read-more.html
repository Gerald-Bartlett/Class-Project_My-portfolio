        <h2><u>Project 1: Python Project 1</u></h2>
        <img id="pjt1"src="./images/Python-project1.png" class="project-img">
        <br> Programmers: Ashley Fillmore, Gerald Bartlett, Michael O'Reilly and John Byrne
         Date: July 30, 2021</p>
        
        <p> This was an employee travel claims program that required the user to enter an option 1-5. Which depending on the option chosen
        and specific data entered such as employee name, number, etc the user then could edit the default values that were pre-entered 
        (ie. Hst, $/kms etc).The user could also print a travel claims report, they could graph the data or just quit the program.

        Ashley Fillmore and Gerald Bartlett did the majority of the coding, Mike O'Reilly and John Byrne helped with the 2 extra required functions and
        read through the whole program multiple times to check for any errors we may have missed, gave opinions and ran
        through the program a few times as well.</p>

       <p> This was an company receipt program that required the user to enter specific data entered such as customer name, number, etc. 
           The program would print a  retail receipt.

       Gerald Bartlett did half the coding, and John Byrne did the remainder. We both 
       read through the whole program multiple times to check for any errors we may have missed, gave opinions and where required adjusted the code
       through the program.</p>

       <img id="pjt2"src="./images/fridge.png" class="project-img-2">
       <br> Programmers: Gerald Bartlett 
       </p>
       
       <p> This was a Group effort program project that required the use of Html / Css using media queries totally  done in React.js.

     Programmers: Gerald Bartlett, Barry Poole & David Temple. We
     each decided to do the same project topic (an idea that Barry had for an app and wanted to build for years) 
     Each of us designed the project our own way and a couple of days later we had chosen the one we would do as a group. 
     
    Barry was the holder of the code, so I took the login page, David took a section and 
    Barry did the Figma small device design (GitHub: Figma Design Group Sprint) and
    I did the desktop view Figma design (GitHub: Group Sprint Project).
    Throughout the project we contacted each other multiple times each day and worked on the coding and CSS together, 
    so really, we each gave input from React JavaScript to the CSS, so it was truly a group effort,
    I believe with the collaborative effort of each of us and the extremely basic understanding of 
    React we have at this time, we had we did a decent job. We must give credit to YouTube and W3 Schools as well. 
    Our entire class helped each other out with problems that each of the groups had.
    We truly have a great bunch of people. Stephen even held a couple of workshops for those who needed help.
